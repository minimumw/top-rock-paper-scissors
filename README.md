# top-rock-paper-scissors
Rock paper scissors project for The Odin Project

Project post-mortem (for console only version)

- One glaring bug still remains that I'm going to leave
- Bug: if user enters anything that is not 'rock' 'paper' or 'scissors', or if they do not enter anything at all, they win the round
- I've been trying to figure out how to get the prompt to reappear if invalid data is provided but no luck
- Leaving this bug bc based on the projects, user selection will be locked down to buttons with event listeners, so less prone to human error
